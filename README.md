### Helpful hints from the past

- While loops are more flexible, If you aren't sure default to a while loop. It may save time. Deleting your looping structure after it's been written is quite painful. 
- Focus on solving the problem before writing any code. Run through at least a couple of examples. It is nearly possible to mentally go back to the design phase once you have started coding.
