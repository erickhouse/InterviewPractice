## The Process

### Algorithms
- Merge Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Quick Sort
- BFS 
- DFS
- Binary search

### Data Structure
- Tree
  - Binary Tree
  - Binary Search Tree 
  - Red Black Tree
    - Self Balancing 
  - B-Tree
    - A type of binary search tree that can have more than two children 
  - Keywords : Balanced, Levels 
- Graph
  - Directed
  - Weighted
  - Each node may or may not have an edge to another node 
- Queue
- Stack
- Array
- List / Vector
- Linked List
- Matrix
- Heap
- Dict / Map
- Set
- Trie 

### Big O

### Techniques

- Dynamic (Bottom up)
  
- Divide and Conquer (top down)
  - How to solve the sub-instance
  - How to combine the obtained solutions
  - Key words: find, subsets

- Transform and Conquer 
  - Turn the input into something that better fits a solution
  - Compute over multiple passes
  - Key words: pre-sort
  
- Greedy 
  - Take what you can get now. The local optimum 
  - Key words: most, best, optimum, candidates 
  
- Windowed 
  - Move a windowed sub set along the super set, looking for something inside the subset 
  - Keywords: ranges, contains
  
### Problems
 - Determine if two ranges overlap `does [5,10] overlap with [2,3], [6,12]`
 - flatten a dict than contains dicts which may contain sub dicts 

## The Interview

### Helpful hints from the past

- While loops are more flexible, If you aren't sure, default to a while loop. It may save time. Deleting your looping structure after it's been written is quite painful. 

- Focus on solving the problem before writing any code. Run through at least a couple of examples. It is nearly possible to mentally go back to the design phase once you have started coding.

- If the problem requires filtering or a reduction step, don't try and do it in place (return a subset) 

- Telling the interviewer about a problem relating to ambiguity or requirements gathering doesn't seems to matter unless it is very specific to the story. They care about technical implementations, the specific problems faced, and how I overcame then. 
  - Possiblity of using ambiguity if the point is to show abstract problem solving or solving business problems
  
- Make a point to practice optimization (greedy) problems, they come up quite often. 
  - Problems involving local candidates while scanning for the best without being able to know what the remainder of the data set includes
  
- Create a systematic way to break down problem types and their names to quickly reduce the problem space. Read books about algorithms and algorithm types.
