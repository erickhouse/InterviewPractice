Solve the problem simply. Think about how you would solve the problem organically and derive an algorithm from that. 
Don't get too focused on how the algorithm needs to work in code. 

Example (insertion sort)

Think about holding a hand of playing cards. How would you naturally put them in order? Find the lowest playing card and move it to the left.
Then find the next lowest card and place it to the right of the first and so on. Maintaining the swap state in your mind is difficult.
