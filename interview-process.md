# Interview Process

## Clairify the problem

Often, being deep into the problem and discovering that you are solving the wrong
problem or made some incorrect assumptions can completely block creative thinking.

### Write out the goal of the problem in plain english.

- The interviewer might be able to stop you early on.
- It's easy to refer back to when you get lost.
- What do you know and not know?

### Declare Contract

Ask what are the input and output types are and their semantics.

- What are the inputs and outputs?
- What is their purpose?
- Does the algoritm return the result or the index where the result occurs?

### Sanitize Input

Remove unknowns to cliarify the problem and edge cases. The interviewer 
could put additional constraits on the input to simplify the solution.

Example: inputs cannot be null.

- Can any of the values be null?
- Can a list be empty?
- Can numbers be negative?

### Generate test cases

Create your own tests cases on top of the provided ones. If no 
test cases were provided, ask for some.

- Try to create tests cases that would break the naive solution.
- Potentially ask the interviewer for test cases that show advanced scenarios.
