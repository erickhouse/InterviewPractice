#### Divide and Concur

- Quick Sort & Merge Sort
- Dividing the problem into sub problems and combininig the solutions into a global solution

#### Greedy

Greedy approaches are great because they're fast (usually just one pass through the input). But they don't work for every problem.

How do you know if a problem will lend itself to a greedy approach? Best bet is to try it out and see if it works. Trying out a greedy approach should be one of the first ways you try to break down a new question.

To try it on a new problem, start by asking yourself:

"Suppose we could come up with the answer in one pass through the input, by simply updating the 'best answer so far' as we went. What additional values would we need to keep updated as we looked at each item in our input, in order to be able to update the 'best answer so far' in constant time?"

#### Dynamic

*writes down "1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 =" on a sheet of paper*
"What's that equal to?"
*counting* "Eight!"
*writes down another "1+" on the left*
"What about that?"
*quickly* "Nine!"
"How'd you know it was nine so fast?"
"You just added one more"
"So you didn't need to recount because you remembered there were eight!
Dynamic Programming is just a fancy way to say 'remembering stuff to save time later'"
